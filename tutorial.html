                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Welcome! In this project you will read sentences generated by Artificial Intelligence and rate their quality.</p>
                <p>To perform this HIT you must be able to:</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>Rate sentences by how well they <b>simplify</b> the sentence while retaining it's <b>meaning</b> and <b>fluency</b>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Here's the big picture of what we're doing:</p>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_9.png" alt="tutorial" width=650>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>The Interface</h3>
                <p>Before explaining the task, here's a guide to understanding the look and feel of the interface:</p>
                <h5>Sentence Categorization</h5>
                <p>Our sentences are presented in three forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Deletion-focused</b> - The AI attempted to simplify the sentence mainly by deleting words</li>
                    <li><b>Paraphrase-focused</b> - A mix between deleting words and re-wording sets of words</li>
                    <li><b>Splitting-focused</b> - Converts the sentence to multiple, simplified sentences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We already placed sentences in each of these categories, these are to help organize the types of simplifications.</p>
                <h5>Sentence Changes</h5>
                <p>We've created some highlights to help you understand how our AI simplified the sentences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class='del'></span> - A <i>deletion</i></li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an <span class='instruction-del'>example</span> sentence → Here's an <span class='del'></span> sentence</p>
                    <li><span class='par'>text</span> - A <i>paraphrase</i>, or re-wording a part of the sentence</li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an <span class='instruction-del'>example</span><span class='instruction-par'>new</span> sentence → Here's an <span class='par'>new</span> sentence</p>
                    <li><span class='spt'></span> - A <i>split</i> was made from one sentence to two separate sentences</li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an example.<span class='spt'></span> <span class='par'>This is a new</span> sentence</p>
                </ul>
                <div style='text-align: center; margin-bottom: 16px;'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_8.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b> Notice the paraphrases, deletions and sentence split is highlighted from the old to the new sentence.</i></p>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>Ranking Sentences</h3>
                <p>The key to this task is <b>ranking sentences</b> by how well they <b>simplify</b> the original sentence. A quality simplification should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simplify</b> the wording, syntax and concepts communicated by the sentence</li>
                    <li>Preserve the <b>meaning</b> of the original sentence</li>
                    <li>Be written <b>fluently</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Click and drag sentences to re-order them.</p>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_0.gif" alt="tutorial" width=400 />
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The highest sentences are the best simplifications.</i></p>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>Rating Sentences</h3>
                <p>The other primary part of ths task is to <b>rate sentences</b> by how well they <b>simplify</b> the original sentence. One challenge is deciding how to score each sentence.</p>
                <p>Here's some general rules for scores:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>100</b> - Only when the sentence is fully simplified, entirely fluent and preserves the entire meaning of the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>75</b> - The sentence is somewhat simpler, mostly fluent and the meaning is close to the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>50</b> - The sentence is simpler, somewhat fluent and the meaning is similar to the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>25</b> - The sentence is equivalently simple, still has some fluency but the meaning is lost</li>
                    <li><b>0</b> - The sentence is completely unreadable</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Most scores will lie somewhere in this range, feel free to give specific scores.</b></p>
                <h5>Examples:</h5>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_2.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>Notice how (1), the sentence reads completely fluently and (2) the orignal meaning of the sentence ("it" getting unstuck and moving to the bottom)</i></p>
                </div>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_7.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>Although the sentence has a error in its fluency, it still has the same meaning as the orignal sentence</i></p>
                </div>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_6.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The sentence is completely unreadable</i></p>
                </div>
                <hr />
