                <h1>Instructions</h1>
                <hr />
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Welcome! In this project you will read sentences generated by Artificial Intelligence and rate their quality.</p>
                <p>To perform this HIT you must be able to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rank sentences by how well they simplify</li>
                    <li>Rate sentences by how well they preserve meaning and literacy</li>
                    <li>Identify sentences in an incorrect category</li>
                    <li>Fix incorrectly labeled changes we made to sentences</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here's the big picture of what we're doing:</p>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_1.png" alt="tutorial" width=650>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>Ranking Sentences</h3>
                <p>The key to this task is <b>ranking sentences</b> by how well they <b>simplify</b> the original sentence. Click and drag sentences to re-order them.</p>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_0.gif" alt="tutorial" width=400 />
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The highest sentences are the most "simple," regardless of whether the sentence is fluent or maintains the original meaning of the sentence</i></p>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>Rating Sentences</h3>
                <p>The other primary part of ths task is to <b>rate sentences</b> by how well they preserve <b>meaning</b> and <b>fluency</b>. One challenge is deciding how to score each sentence.</p>
                <p>Here's some general rules for scores:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>100</b> - Only when the sentence is entirely fluent and preserves the entire meaning of the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>75</b> - The sentence is mostly fluent and the meaning is close to the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>50</b> - The sentence is somewhat fluent and the meaning is similar to the original sentence</li>
                    <li><b>25</b> - The sentence still has some fluency but the meaning is lost</li>
                    <li><b>0</b> - The sentence is completely unreadable</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Most scores will lie somewhere in this range, feel free to give specific scores.</b></p>
                <h5>Examples:</h5>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_2.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>Notice how (1), the sentence reads completely fluently and (2) the orignal meaning of the sentence ("it" getting unstuck and moving to the bottom)</i></p>
                </div>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_7.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>Although the sentence has a error in its fluency, it still has the same meaning as the orignal sentence</i></p>
                </div>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_6.png" alt="tutorial" width=500>
                </div>
                <div class='explanation'>
                    <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The sentence is completely unreadable</i></p>
                </div>
                <hr />
                <h3>Categorizing Sentences</h3>
                <p>Our sentences are presented in three forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Deletion-focused</b> - The AI attempted to simplify the sentence mainly by deleting words</li>
                    <li><b>Paraphrase-focused</b> - A mix between deleting words and re-wording sets of words</li>
                    <li><b>Splitting-focused</b> - Converts the sentence to multiple, simplified sentences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We already placed sentences in each of these categories, but sometimes these placements are wrong.</p>
                <p>If the sentence is in the wrong caregory, <b>click and drag</b> the sentence to its correct category.</p>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_3.gif" alt="tutorial" width=400 />
                </div>
                <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The sentences that were primarily deletion needed to be moved to the deletion category, the splitting and rephrasing categories were similar</i></p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Fixing Changes in Sentences</h3>
                <p>By now you may have noticed our notation for how the AI modifies sentences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class='del'></span> - A <i>deletion</i></li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an <span class='instruction-del'>example</span> sentence → Here's an <span class='del'></span> sentence</p>
                    <li><span class='par'>text</span> - A <i>paraphrase</i>, or re-wording a part of the sentence</li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an <span class='instruction-del'>example</span><span class='instruction-par'>new</span> sentence → Here's an <span class='par'>new</span> sentence</p>
                    <li><span class='spt'></span> - A <i>split</i> was made from one sentence to two separate sentences</li>
                    <p style='margin-left:16px'>Here's an example sentence → Here's an example.<span class='spt'></span> <span class='par'>This is a new</span> sentence</p>
                </ul>
                <p>We already labeled these edits for you, but sometimes they are incorrect.</p>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <div style='text-align: center'> 
                    <img src="img/tutorial_4.png" alt="tutorial" width=600>
                </div>
                <p><i><b>Explanation: </b>The edits aren't deleting text, they are changing the wording. Also, the last three edits should really be considered one large paraphrase rather than three small ones.</i></p>
                <p>When rating each sentence, pay attention to the labels, if they are incorrect, click the fix button to change the edits.</p>
                <div style='text-align: center'>
                    <img src="img/tutorial_5.gif" alt="tutorial" width=600 />
                </div>
                <p style='margin-top: 8px;'>Using this editor, there's a couple important items to note:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>To change a paraphrase</i> - <b>Click and drag</b> the <span class='color:blue'>blue</span> arrow at the end of the phrase.</li>
                    <li><i>To add a paraphrase</i> - <b>Select an area</b> of the text that isn't bolded</li>
                    <li><i>To change a deletion or split</i> - <b>Click and drag</b> the deletion (<span class='del'></span>) or split (<span class='spt'></span>)</li>
                    <li><i>To remove a deletion or split</i> - <b>Double click</b> the deletion (<span class='del'></span>) or split (<span class='spt'></span>)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>Remember to take your time! In this HIT you are doing 4 separate sub-tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rank sentences based on how well they <i>simplify</i> they original sentence</li>
                    <li>Rate senteces based on how well they preseve <i>meaning</i> and <i>fluency</i>.</li>
                    <li>Fix categorization of sentences</li>
                    <li>Fix errors in our generated sentence changes</li>
                </ul>
